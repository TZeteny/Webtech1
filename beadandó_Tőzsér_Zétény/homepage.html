                <p><span style="color:rgb(73, 43, 6); font-weight:bold">A sword is an edged, bladed weapon intended for manual cutting or thrusting.
                 Its blade, longer than a knife or dagger, is attached to a hilt
                  and can be straight or curved. A thrusting sword tends to have
                   a straighter blade with a pointed tip. A slashing sword is
                    more likely to be curved and to have a sharpened cutting edge
                     on one or both sides of the blade. Many swords are designed for both
                      thrusting and slashing.</span></p>
                <p>Thrusting swords such as the rapier and eventually the smallsword were
                 designed to impale their targets quickly and inflict deep stab wounds. 
                 Their long and straight yet light and well balanced design made them highly
                  maneuverable and deadly in a duel but fairly ineffective when used in a
                   slashing or chopping motion. A well aimed lunge and thrust could end
                    a fight in seconds with just the sword's point, leading to the development
                     of a fighting style which closely resembles modern fencing.
                The sabre and similar blades such as the cutlass were built more
                 heavily and were more typically used in warfare. Built for slashing
                  and chopping at multiple enemies, often from horseback, the sabre's
                   long curved blade and slightly forward weight balance gave it a deadly
                    character all its own on the battlefield. Most sabres also had sharp
                     points and double-edged blades, making them capable of piercing soldier
                      after soldier in a cavalry charge.</p>
